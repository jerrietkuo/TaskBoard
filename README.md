# Task Board

A simple task board application that allows a team to manage project tasks. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## User Storytory


As a project team member with multiple tasks to organize, I want a task board so that I can add individual project tasks, manage their state of progress, and track overall project progress accordingly.

## Acceptance Criteriaa


- When I open the task board, the list of project tasks is displayed in columns representing the task progress state (Not Yet Started, In Progress, Completed).
- When I view the task board for the project, each task is color coded to indicate whether it is nearing the deadline (yellow) or is overdue (red).
- When I click on the button to define a new task, I can enter the title, description, and deadline date for the new task into a modal dialog.
- When I click the save button for that task, the properties for that task are saved in localStorage.
- When I drag a task to a different progress column, the task's progress state is updated accordingly and will stay in the new column after refreshing.
- When I click the delete button for a task, the task is removed from the task board and will not be added back after refreshing.
- When I refresh the page, the saved tasks persist.
